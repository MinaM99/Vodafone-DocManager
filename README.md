# Vodafone Documentum Documents Manager

## About the Project

The **Vodafone-DocManager** is an integration between Vodafone and Documentum, designed with two primary functionalities:

1. **Document Statistics**:
   - Displays comprehensive statistics on documents processed by Documentum.
   - Tracks successful and failed document processing, providing insights into operational performance.

2. **Records Archiving**:
   - Facilitates the archiving of physical documents.
   - Uses QR code scanning to input details such as box number, MSISDN, and document type.
   - Checks for the existence of a corresponding digital document in the system.
   - Creates and links a physical document to the identified digital document for efficient record management.

Additionally, the **v2 branch** in GitHub introduces enhanced **user session management** by replacing session storage with **cookies-based logic**. This approach ensures:

- **One user per browser** for tighter session control.
- **Cross-tab login consistency**, allowing the user to stay logged in across all tabs of the same browser.
- Improved security and session management.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- PM2 process manager installed
- Tomcat server installed and running

## Frontend Setup & Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Access the app in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Deploy to Tomcat
1. Configure `WEB-INF/web.xml`:

- Inside the `Vodafone-DocManager/frontend/build` folder, create a new directory called `WEB-INF`.
   - In the `WEB-INF` directory, create a file named `web.xml` and add the following content:
     
     ```xml
     <web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" version="3.0">
         <welcome-file-list>
             <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
         </welcome-file-list>

         <error-page>
             <error-code>404</error-code>
             <location>/index.html</location>
         </error-page>
     </web-app>
     ```

   This step is necessary to handle client-side routing correctly in a React application. When using React Router, refreshing or directly accessing a route (e.g., `/login`) can result in a `404 Not Found` error because the Tomcat server tries to resolve the route itself instead of serving `index.html`. The `web.xml` configuration ensures that any unrecognized route will fallback to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle the routing.

2. Navigate to Tomcatâ€™s `webapps` directory.
3. Create a new folder named `Vodafone-DocManager`:
   ```bash
   <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/Vodafone-DocManager
   ```
4. Copy the `build` folder contents:
   ```bash
   cp -r build/* <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/Vodafone-DocManager
   ```

5. Restart Tomcat and access at:
```
http://localhost:<TOMCAT_PORT>/Vodafone-DocManager
```

## Backend Setup & Deployment


## Setup & Deployment

### 1. Install Node.js

Before proceeding, ensure that **Node.js** is installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can download and install it from the official website:

- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify if Node.js is installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

This will display the version of Node.js installed. Make sure it is at least version **12.x** or higher to ensure compatibility with the backend.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once Node.js is installed, navigate to your backend directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### 3. Install PM2

PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications. It will help in keeping the backend running smoothly and in managing it effectively.

To install PM2 globally, use the following command:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

Make sure PM2 is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
pm2 -v
```

If PM2 is installed correctly, this will display the version number.

### 4. Start the Backend with PM2

Once PM2 is installed, you can start the backend application by running:

```bash
pm2 start server.js
```

This will start your backend server. PM2 will now keep the server running and manage the process.

### 5. Monitor PM2 Process

To check which applications are currently running under PM2, use:

```bash
pm2 list
```

This will display a list of all running applications along with their status.

If you need to view the logs of the application, use:

```bash
pm2 logs
```

This will show the real-time logs of your backend application.

### 6. Auto-Restart Backend on System Reboot

To ensure that your backend server automatically restarts if the system reboots, follow these steps:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

This will generate a command to set PM2 to start automatically when your server reboots. 

After this, save the current process list:

```bash
pm2 save
```

This command will ensure that your running applications (in this case, the backend) are restored after a reboot.
