# Vodafone Documentum Documents Manager

## About the Project

The **Vodafone-DocManager** is an integration between Vodafone and Documentum, designed with two primary functionalities:

1. **Document Statistics**:
   - Displays comprehensive statistics on documents processed by Documentum.
   - Tracks successful and failed document processing, providing insights into operational performance.

2. **Records Archiving**:
   - Facilitates the archiving of physical documents.
   - Uses QR code scanning to input details such as box number, MSISDN, and document type.
   - Checks for the existence of a corresponding digital document in the system.
   - Creates and links a physical document to the identified digital document for efficient record management.

Additionally, the **v2 branch** in GitHub introduces enhanced **user session management** by replacing session storage with **cookies-based logic**. This approach ensures:

- **One user per browser** for tighter session control.
- **Cross-tab login consistency**, allowing the user to stay logged in across all tabs of the same browser.
- Improved security and session management.
